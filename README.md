[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/AUAS-Pulsar/Asteria.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/AUAS-Pulsar/Asteria)

>  Asteria is a rewrite of the SIGPROC package designed to standardize the initial analysis of the many types of fast-sampled pulsar data. The SIGPROC tools should help users look at their data quickly, without the need to write (yet) another routine to read data.
